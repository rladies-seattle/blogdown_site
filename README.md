## To Update the Site

To update the site with a new presentation:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Go to data > projects.yml.
3. Add a new entry at the top with the icon, date, title, speaker, and link. The icon should correspond to your link â€” `fa fa-file` for a Google presentation, `fa fa-github` for a Github repo, etc. If you have the notes document for your session, please paste the "View Only" URL under description.
4. Open R/RStudio and install associated packages
    ```
    install.packages("blogdown")
    blogdown::install_hugo()
    ```
5. Run `blogdown::serve_site()`. The site should render.
6. Tag `ivelasq`, `katiejolly`, or `monicagerber` to review and approve the pull request.
